        Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava (STU) (Slovak: Slovenská technická univerzita v Bratislave) is the biggest and oldest university of technology in Slovakia. In the 2012 Academic Ranking of World Universities it was ranked in the first 150 in Computer Science,[1] the only university in central Europe in the first 200. However, it lost this position in the two following years.[2]The Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava signed a Memorandum of Understanding [3][4] with the European Alliance for Innovation on the 3rd of May 2013. 
        The signators were the president of the European Alliance for Innovation, professor Imrich Chlamtac and the rector of the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, Robert Redhammer.

The purpose of this cooperation is to help innovation made in the STU to reach the market, as well as create a base of operations for EAI in Central Europe.

        <h3>About us and this Page</h3>
        <p>We are two students from FEI STU (some of you may recognize me by my nickname), as you may noticed this page is 
            made primary for students from Applied Informatics. My and my partner are part of student organizations.
